# Evaluate if the generated code quality satisfies requirements

## Ask LLM to evaluate if the solution is optimal or not. This is a good way to come out of halucinations and get optimal and simple code.
```
Evaluate each aspect of the solution with these key questions:
Does the analysis directly address the problem?
Were all possible causes considered, or are there unassessed factors?
Is this the simplest and most direct solution?
Is it feasible in terms of resources and costs?
Will the solution have the expected impact, and is it sustainable?
Are there ways to simplify or improve the solution?
What are the essential requirements versus those that are just a plus?
Show me the minimal reproducible example.
What edge cases should we consider?
What testing approach would validate this solution?
If you identify ambiguities, suggest clarifying questions and, if possible, offer improvement alternatives.
