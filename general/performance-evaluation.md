# Prompt for performance evaliuation.

### Sourced from Jeff Su

```
I am preparing for a performance review at my company where my 
work is evaluated against three key attributes: 
Attribute 1, 
Attribute 2, 
Attribute 3 

As part of this process, I need to write a self-assessment that reflects 
my contributions over the last two quarters. I would like this self-assessment to justify a high performance rating. 

To help with this task, I will provide definitions for each of the three attributes and a summary of my projects and contributions. I would like 
you to: 

1. Assign each of my projects to one of the three attributes where it best fits. Please ensure that each project is only assigned once. 

2. Write a positive and detailed self-assessment for each attribute, explaining how my projects demonstrate my proficiency in that area. Include specific examples and details. 

3. Highlight the impact of my work by including quantifiable metrics where possible. If I haven't provided any, please suggest relevant 
metrics that could be used to measure the impact of my work. 

Here are the definitions of the attributes:

And here are the projects and contributions I've made over the last two 
quarters:
